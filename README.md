## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learnt a lot about how to work with lists and tables and how to target and not target certain elements using child selectors in CSS.
I tried using Tailwind CSS but found this to take too long and be ver cumbersome.
